"""Fast image-domain a-term (primary-beam) correction for gridded prediction.

The FITS-image path predicts ``V = sum_pix I(x) K(u, x)`` with ``ducc0``'s
wgridder. With direction-dependent effects the quantity is instead

    V_pq(t, nu) = sum_pix  [ E_p(t, nu, x) . B(nu, x) . E_q(t, nu, x)^H ]_c  K(u, x, nu)

where ``E_p`` is antenna p's 2x2 voltage beam (the *a-term*) and ``B`` the sky
coherency built from the Stokes planes. The exact answer is a per-source DFT
(``predict_vis_beam``/``predict_vis_jones``), which costs
``O(nrow * nchan * ncomp * ncorr)`` and is hopeless for a filled image
(``ncomp ~ npix``). WSClean's IDG solves this by applying a-terms to gridded
subgrids per time/frequency chunk; DDFacet's facet scheme applies a piecewise-
constant (per-facet) a-term and grids per facet. This module uses the same core
idea -- *apply the a-term in the image domain, amortised over blocks of
visibilities within which it barely changes* -- with one simplification
available to a simulator that only degrids: the a-term is multiplied into the
**full image** (no spatial facet/subgrid approximation), so the *only*
approximation relative to the DFT is interpolation of the a-term in time and
frequency, both with controlled error and both exact in the limit of dense
knots.

Decomposition and cost rationale
--------------------------------
Every optimisation below is either exact or carries an explicit error control:

1. **Baseline classes (exact).** ``E_p`` depends on antenna p only through its
   beam *type* (the ``TELESCOPE_NAME``-keyed provider). Rows are partitioned by
   the ordered type pair ``(type_p, type_q)``; within a class the a-term is
   baseline-independent, so one apparent image serves the whole class. This is
   an exact regrouping -- heterogeneous arrays cost ``n_used_type_pairs`` image
   passes instead of being (wrongly) averaged away.

2. **Time: per-antenna linear interpolation on the PA grid (error O(dt^2),
   same semantics as the DFT kernel).** The beam rotates with parallactic
   angle. The exact-DFT path samples each type's beam on the uniform-in-time
   grid of :func:`simms.skymodel.beams.pa_sample_grid` and interpolates each
   *antenna's* voltage linearly between the bracketing knots. We reproduce
   that contraction identically in the image domain: with per-row weight
   ``w`` toward knot ``k+1``,

       g_p g_q^* = (1-w)^2 G_k G_k^* + w^2 G_{k+1} G_{k+1}^*
                   + w(1-w) (G_k G_{k+1}^* + G_{k+1} G_k^*)

   so a row's visibility is a *quadratic blend of three image products*: the
   two "diagonal" knot images and one "cross" image per time bin (the two
   cross terms share a weight, and prediction is linear in the image, so they
   are summed into a single image). Diagonal-knot passes are shared by the two
   bins adjacent to a knot, so a block spanning ``nbin`` bins costs
   ``nbin + 1`` diagonal + ``nbin`` cross passes per class -- not ``3 nbin``.
   Because the blend is algebraically identical to the DFT kernel's
   interpolation, the two paths agree to gridder accuracy (this is asserted in
   the tests), and the existing ``--beam-pa-step`` knob controls the error of
   both paths in the same way.

3. **Frequency: adaptive knots (error O(dnu^2), tolerance-driven).** The beam
   also scales with frequency. A flat-spectrum image otherwise needs only
   *one* gridder pass for the whole band (the gridder scales ``uvw`` per
   channel), so evaluating the beam per channel would multiply the FFT count
   by ``nchan``. Instead the band is split at knot channels chosen greedily so
   that a linear interpolation of every type's *voltage* beam between adjacent
   knots is within ``freq_tol`` (in voltage units, beam peak ~1) of the true
   beam on a probe grid covering the image. Each channel's visibility is then
   a linear blend of the two bracketing knot passes -- by linearity of the
   prediction this equals predicting with the frequency-interpolated apparent
   image. First-order, a voltage error ``e`` on each of the two antennas gives
   a fractional visibility error ``<= ~2 e`` on that source's contribution.
   Models that already pay a per-channel FFT (spectral cubes, per-pixel
   log-polynomials -- the sky itself changes per channel) interpolate the
   a-term *image* per channel instead, which is the same approximation without
   extra FFTs. Setting ``freq_tol <= 0`` forces a knot at every channel
   (exact).

4. **Per-type voltage maps, cached (exact).** The pixel maps ``G_type(t_knot,
   f_knot)`` -- not per-antenna, not per-class -- are the only beam
   evaluations. They are cached in a byte-capped LRU shared by all row blocks
   (dask's thread scheduler shares the prepared model), keyed time-independent
   for non-ALT-AZ mounts. Class images are cheap pixelwise products of cached
   maps with the Stokes planes.

5. **Negligible-pass skipping (error below the gridder's own floor).** A pass
   whose apparent image peaks below ``epsilon * peak_brightness`` is dropped:
   its contribution is smaller than the accuracy the gridder is already
   allowed to miss on the brightest emission. This is what silently removes
   the imaginary-part passes for real (e.g. cosine-taper) beams and the
   cross-hand passes of unpolarised skies, instead of hard-coding either
   special case. At most a few tens of passes touch one (row, channel) cell,
   so the worst-case accumulated skip error stays ``O(10 epsilon)``.

Complex images cost two real gridder passes (Re and Im) because the wgridder
consumes real dirty images; skipping (5) makes the common real-beam case pay
one.

Total cost per (row-block, channel-segment):
``(n_knots_touched + n_bins) * n_classes * ncorr * {1|2}`` FFT+degrid passes,
each degridding only its own rows/channels, versus one pass with no beam and
``O(nrow * nchan * npix_support * ncorr)`` for the exact DFT. For a 4k-channel,
8h MeerKAT-like observation with a 1-degree PA step and default ``freq_tol``,
that is tens of image FFTs -- orders of magnitude below the DFT.
