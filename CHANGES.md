### 3.0.0 -> 3.0.1

- gitingore poetry|uv.lock
- Port cabs to shinobi/dosho
- Fix `-pb` duplicate abbrevation. The `primary-beam` option retains it
  and `predict-backend` looses it
- `primary-beam` declares `ms` alongside `output` in its pystep outputs, so
  `tag-ms` (which mutates the MS in place) can be chained from in a recipe
