Simms 3.0
===========

Introduction
------------

**simms** is a simulation framework built around two key tools: ``telsim`` and ``skysim``:

- ``telsim``: Creates simulated Radio Interferometry Array data (visibilities) into `MS files <https://casa.nrao.edu/Memos/229.html>`_
- ``skysim``: Populates this MS by simulating visibilities, given a sky model. ``skysim`` also has an additional feature that lets you add or subtract from an existing data column.
