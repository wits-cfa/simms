Primary beams and a-terms
===========================

Every antenna has a direction-dependent voltage response -- the primary beam --
that attenuates sources away from where the dish points and rotates on the sky
with parallactic angle. simms can apply that response while predicting
visibilities, per antenna, without assuming the array is homogeneous.

This page covers what the options mean and when to reach for them. For the exact
flags and defaults, see :doc:`../cli`.

Where the beam is centred
---------------------------

The beam is centred on the **antenna pointing centre**, ``POINTING.DIRECTION``
-- not on ``FIELD.PHASE_DIR``, which is the correlator's phase-tracking centre
and can be shifted freely. Conflating the two silently mis-centres the beam. See
:doc:`ms-conventions` for the full rule.

``POINTING`` is keyed by ``(ANTENNA_ID, TIME)``, so each antenna has its own
pointing record and the beam centre is well defined per antenna.

Choosing a beam model
-----------------------

``--primary-beam`` takes either of two things.

**A simms beam-config YAML** maps each telescope/type label found in the
``ANTENNA`` table to a beam model. The label comes from the column named by
``--telescope-name-column`` (default ``TELESCOPE_NAME``), which is the single
source of truth for which antenna is which kind of dish:

.. code-block:: yaml

    MKAT-MA:
      jimbeam: L
    MKAT-EA:
      jimbeam: MKAT-EA-L-JIM-2026.csv

Each entry selects a provider by its key:

``jimbeam``
    A cosine-taper ("JimBeam") model: a band shorthand (``L``, ``UHF``), a
    bundled coefficient table, or a path to your own CSV. When the value omits
    the band, ``--beam-band`` supplies the default.

``fits``
    A FITS beam cube for that telescope type.

``cattery``
    A Cattery/DDFacet beam set, with optional per-entry ``pol_basis``
    (default ``linear``), ``l_axis`` (default ``-X``) and ``m_axis`` (default
    ``Y``) alongside it. Because the convention is declared here, the
    ``--beam-l-axis`` / ``--beam-m-axis`` command-line options do not apply to
    YAML configs.

An entry with none of these keys, or a telescope label with no entry at all,
falls back to a unity (flat) beam and logs a warning -- worth checking for in
the log if a run comes out unattenuated.

The bundled ``MKAT-AA-*`` tables and the cosine-taper model itself are vendored
from `katbeam <https://github.com/ska-sa/katbeam>`_ under BSD-3-Clause; see
``src/simms/skymodel/beam_data/NOTICE``.

**A Cattery/DDFacet heterogeneous-beam JSON** (any path ending in ``.json``) is
the ``--Beam-FITSFile`` json form, keyed by ``ANTENNA.NAME``. It points at FITS
beam cubes rather than analytic tables. Because those cubes carry their own axis
conventions, ``--beam-l-axis`` and ``--beam-m-axis`` must be set to the same
values you would pass DDFacet's ``--Beam-FITSLAxis`` / ``--Beam-FITSMAxis``.
These two options apply only to the ``.json`` form; a YAML config declares the
convention per entry instead.

Heterogeneous arrays are the normal case here: an MS whose ``ANTENNA`` table
mixes ``MKAT-MA`` and ``MKAT-EA`` dishes gets a different beam per antenna, and
each baseline sees the product of its two antennas' responses rather than a
single array-wide beam.

Diagonal or full Jones
------------------------

``--beam-jones diagonal`` applies a per-feed voltage response: each feed is
attenuated independently and the cross-hands carry no beam leakage.

``--beam-jones full`` applies the full 2x2 E-Jones, so off-diagonal terms
(instrumental polarisation leakage from the beam) are included. Use it when the
leakage matters to what you are simulating -- polarisation calibration or
wide-field polarimetry -- and when your beam model actually provides the
off-diagonal elements. For Cattery/DDFacet beams, a circular-correlation MS is
supported in this mode.

Beams in the FITS-image path
------------------------------

Applying a beam to a component list is straightforward: each component sits at
one direction, so it gets one gain. A FITS *image* sky model has no such
shortcut, and ``--fits-beam-mode`` picks between two ways of handling it.

``--fits-beam-mode aterm`` (the exact treatment) applies per-antenna a-terms in
the image domain, interpolated in time and frequency and aware of array
heterogeneity. It makes no spatial approximation: the beam varies across the
image as it really does, and each baseline gets its own pair of antenna
responses.

``--fits-beam-mode average`` multiplies the sky by a single parallactic-angle
averaged power beam. This is the legacy approximation -- one beam for the whole
array, averaged over the track. It is cheaper, and adequate when the beam is
nearly constant over your field and observation, but it cannot represent a
heterogeneous array or the rotation of an asymmetric beam.

Controlling a-term cost
-------------------------

The exact a-term path samples the beam on grids that you can trade against
accuracy:

``--aterm-freq-tol`` bounds the error of interpolating the a-term linearly in
frequency between knot channels, in voltage-beam units where the beam peak is
about 1. Smaller values insert more frequency knots and cost more; ``0`` or
negative samples the beam at every channel and does no interpolation at all.

``--beam-pa-step`` sets the spacing, in degrees, of the parallactic-angle grid
the beam is sampled on. A long track through transit rotates the beam quickly
near zenith, so a coarse step there is the usual source of error.

``--beam-grid-max-gib`` is a hard ceiling on how much of the sampled beam grid
is held in memory for the whole run. It is a guard rail, not a tuning knob: hit
it and you need a coarser grid, not a bigger machine.

The standalone ``primary-beam`` tool
--------------------------------------

``simms primary-beam`` exposes the beam machinery without simulating any
visibilities. It has four modes:

``to-fits``
    Evaluate a beam model onto a FITS cube. ``--fits-format simms`` writes
    simms's own single-file 4-plane HH/VV cube; ``--fits-format cattery`` writes
    the Cattery/DDFacet 8-file per-Jones-element schema that ``--Beam-Model
    FITS`` expects, in which case ``--pol-basis`` must match the target MS's feed
    basis (``linear`` for xx/xy/yx/yy, ``circular`` for rr/rl/lr/ll).

``tag-ms``
    Write the per-antenna telescope/type labels into the ``ANTENNA`` table
    column named by ``--telescope-name-column``, so an MS from elsewhere can be
    given the metadata skysim needs to pick a beam per antenna.

``apply`` / ``correct``
    Multiply a sky model by the beam, or divide it out, writing a new sky model
    rather than touching visibilities. Takes ``--fits-sky`` or ``--ascii-sky``.

Because ``to-fits`` and ``tag-ms`` write ordinary MS metadata and FITS files,
they compose with tools outside simms -- you can build a beam here and hand it
to DDFacet, or tag an MS that another simulator produced.
