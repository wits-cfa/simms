Measurement Set conventions
=============================

simms follows a few `Measurement Set (MS)
<https://casa.nrao.edu/Memos/229.html>`_ conventions that are easy to get
wrong if you're scripting around it directly (rather than through
:doc:`telsim`/:doc:`skysim`).

Telescope metadata has a single source of truth
--------------------------------------------------

The per-antenna telescope/type label lives in the ``ANTENNA`` table column
named by ``--telescope-name-column`` (default ``TELESCOPE_NAME``). This is
what :doc:`skysim` reads to select a primary beam per antenna. It is never
inferred from other columns such as ``DISH_DIAMETER`` -- if the column is
absent, tools should fail clearly rather than guess.

Pointing centre vs. phase centre
-----------------------------------

These are two different directions, and conflating them silently mis-centres
the primary beam:

- ``FIELD.PHASE_DIR`` is the correlator's phase-tracking centre. It is
  arbitrary and can be shifted (e.g. by phase rotation) without changing
  where the antennas are actually pointing.
- ``POINTING.DIRECTION`` is the antenna pointing centre, and is what the
  primary beam is centred on.

Use :func:`simms.skymodel.beams.read_pointing_centre` to get the beam centre
rather than reading ``FIELD.PHASE_DIR`` directly.

Spectral frame must be set
-----------------------------

``SPECTRAL_WINDOW.MEAS_FREQ_REF`` must be ``5`` (TOPO). ``casacore`` defaults
this to ``0`` (REST), which leaves the spectral frame undefined and makes CASA
imaging fail with *"No MeasFrame specified for conversion of Frequency"*.
``telsim`` sets this correctly when it creates an MS.

STRING columns
----------------

``casacore`` STRING columns are numpy ``object`` dtype, and simms writes them
in one chunk (``da.from_array(values, chunks=n)``). Adding a *new* column to a
standard subtable needs an explicit descriptor, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    xds_to_table(..., "{ms}::ANTENNA", columns=[col], descriptor="mssubtable('ANTENNA')")
