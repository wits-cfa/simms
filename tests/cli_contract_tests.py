"""Contract tests for the generated CLI surface.

The options of every subcommand are generated from its pydantic ``inputs_model`` by
shinobi's ``build_options``, so ``--help`` cannot drift from the model. It can still drift
from the *code*: an option can be declared and never read, and a help string can promise a
value syntax that the rendered click type rejects. Both have happened. These tests check the
whole option surface at once, so a new option cannot reintroduce either.
